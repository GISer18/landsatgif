Create High Resolution GIF animation From Landsat 8 images

A realy simple python script to create GIF from Landsat 8 image.

Philosophy of the 'method' is to select a point (search for data) and then create an AOI (extract pixels)

I'm reading data directly on Amazon Server, so date range should be set after January 1st 2015. 

To Do
-------

- [ ] Create a command line version
- [ ] Test if multiple Path-Row
- [ ] Optimize GIF Creation
- [ ] Optimize color matching
